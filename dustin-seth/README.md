**Author**: Seth Donohue, Dustin Mundy
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application builds the DOM through use of an articles array that has all the information for each article stored in a separate .js file so the HTML file is not cluttered with articles. It makes it easier to organize and add an article, and also automatically sorts the articles by date. Adding an article to the blog is easy!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1.) Create a script to hold all the article information in an array of objects, which is the raw data.
2.) Create a second script that Sorts the data in those files.
3.) Use that second script to also create new articles as objects with key:value pairs and then appends these articles to the DOM through use of jQuery.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
1.) Create a script to hold all the article information in an array of objects, which is the raw data.
